    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Vin√≠cius. A Full-Stack developer from Brazil who loves working with clients from around the world on helping them build their solutions into reality.
      In my free time, I love exploring new technologies and building small and Open Source prototypes and this blogs is a ways of documenting my journey of doing it. I am very excited about sharing my progress and discoveries with the tech community.
      Besides that, I also enjoy playing the Bass and the Guitar and reading.
