I have been officially freelancing since August 2018. I had just gotten back from my exchange in Chile and I was looking to put into practice everything I had been studying so far. So I signed up to Upwork and, within a week, I got my first client.

I had one more year of university to go, so I would need to conciliate my freelance jobs with my academic studies. Here are some valuable lessons I learned from it.

## Working from home does not mean overworking.
<br>
There’s no running away from it, work-life balance is crucial for a healthy work/study routine.

We all know that overworking is not healthy. It’s even worse when responsibilities start to pile up. One no longer sleeps properly and their focus is just a struggle.

I had been there. I had done that. It hit me really hard, since I usually love doing what I do. I would naturally overwork as long as my curiosity would be leading me through learning new and challenging things. However, when it happened, it was really stressful. I would be doing everything I was supposed to be doing out of stress and I could no longer see any pleasure or satisfaction from any of it.

But, within months, I got everything back together. I managed to find time for everything, including new things I wanted to learn. Now, many months since I have accomplished it, work is a breeze, I am back to learning things that interest me, I have time for doing everything I enjoy. I’m even getting back to teaching myself languages and could be going back to music soon.

The main takeaway from it, I think, is: I have my own thin line between working hard and overworking. All I needed was to think about it and decide how much wouldn’t be too much to do. And, one important thing is, among all the stress and anxiety, there’s always an option, a decision one needs to make to get back on track. I embraced it.

## Procrastination leads to a very stressful routine
<br>
I remember the first semester of university while I was working. Assignments and homework piling up throughout the semester, while I was busy at work, overworking many weeks and in a schedule that did not suit me at all. Then the end of the semester came and I had had enough of it.

This is when I started using SCRUM and Trello Boards directly. I started taking what I had learned from working in a Startup and putting it into practice. I started organizing everything I had to do and analyzing what was leading me to procrastination. As it turns out, I always had too much to do and failed to break it down to smaller and chewable steps. I would just postpone everything until it could no longer be postponed. It was a nightmare.

The main takeaway was: Break it down to smaller steps, nothing is too hard that cannot be solved throughout through thought. I also learned to set personal deadlines, instead of the final ones, this way I could have more time to plan things out and it would be more error-prone.

Taking breaks and letting your brain do the work: The use of diffuse-mode learning

I can’t stress this enough, this point was one of the most valuable lessons I learned and applied throughout this time. I got it from the book A Mind For Number, by Barbara Oakley; it is a very important book to read, I am fascinated by it and soon I will write a post about it.

The point is, it teaches us all about diffuse-mode learning, which is basically letting your brain do the work while not being actively focused on the problem. This highlights the importance of taking breaks. In the book, Dr. Oakley talks about sitting back and letting our brain do the work. For example, taking walks or going to the gym between study or work sessions or, studying before falling asleep. It’s very fascinating and it helped me a lot throughout my journey.

This is what I have learned. Please let me know if you have any questions!
