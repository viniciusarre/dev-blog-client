### What is this blog about?
<br>

Hello kind reader! I have considered creating this blog for over a month now, in order to be a way to document and start a discussion about my own journey as a Full Stack Developer. Here I will share some anecdotal evidence and comments on my learning and experience so far. I find writing as one of the best ways to express myself, in my teenage years, I have published two short stories in two different Brazilian anthologies and since then, I haven´t written much… which is something I miss.

Hopefully, if you read through, it will help you give some insights about who I am, where I´m from and what I do. With that said, I think that, the best way to start is to talk a bit about myself.

### Who am I ?
<br>

Hi, my name is Vinícius, I'm a 23-year-old Web Developer from Brazil. I grew up playing in an orchestra, having played the Trumpet and the French Horn for nine years, (from 9 to 18 years old).  It was a wonderful experience, since it taught me teamwork and collaborating with others from an early age. Being in concert, for instance, is one of the most direct forms of teamwork I have experienced. There were around 40 musicians playing together, in synchrony with each other and at the same time. Everyone playing an important role towards what other people had been listening. Besides that, I recorded two CDs with them, one commemorating the city’s anniversary, and the other containing mostly original music.

Since I was 15, I started teaching myself new things, what had impressed teachers and peers around me alike, as I picked the interest on learning a new language. Before I move on, however, I would like to give you, reader, a bit of context. According to numbers, most Brazilians do not speak a foreign language as adults, and, back then, the idea of self-learning was unheard of (It was before applications like Duolingo, which popularized language learning went mainstream). Coming from a Brazilian middleclass family, I was unable to attend to language classes, as they were quite expensive and out of my budget at the time. Therefore, self-learning was the only option…

I have learned so much by teaching myself new things, it changed my outlook in an exciting and permanent way. So I fed into my curiosity and, as time went by, it became an intrinsic part of my personality, molding the mindset and attitudes I have today, building up a curious mind.

I imagine that, by now, you would be thinking something like ¨Yeah, that’s great, but what does that have to do with software or web development?¨. I am, rhetorically, glad you asked!

As  the time for me to choose a career path I wanted to follow drew nearer, I was not sure what I wanted to do. When I finished school, I still did not know. I had considered becoming a musician at first, since I had already been involved with music for a long time. But, as it turned out, it wasn’t it I really wanted.

The next obvious option for me, at the time, would be languages. I had at the time, learned more languages and communicated with people from different places in the world and I was fascinated by them. But, as time went by, it wasn’t it either. Then I spent this year thinking about it, pondering the pros and cons, what would be a good match for my profile, as well as many other things. After some time, thinking about different career paths such as becoming a journalist, going for an International Relations degree, or, even becoming a lawyer. None of them really made me feel excited enough… back then, they did not seem interesting or challenging enough for me…

That’s when it hit me. I was in love with languages in a broader sense. For example, I really liked music and spoken languages because they were all about learning a new way of expression or communication, which comes all the way from not understanding them properly to being proficient in them. For example, the same excitement in studying something brand new (a music sheet or a new language) and slowly but surely understanding them, was what drove me back then. This is what fascinated me about them, in general, and made them challenging to me.

With some further research, I came across a course on Web Development in a university in the region. It was challenging in the beginning, but very interesting. I worked hard on mastering the basics from university (I love algorithm and data structures) and, in no time, I was already learning new technologies on my own. By the end of my second year, I got an opportunity to study in Chile for a semester. And, when I was back to my third and final year, I was already working as a freelance full stack developer with clients from around the world.

This is what my journey has been like so far. Thank you for reading and, please, let me know if you have any questions.
