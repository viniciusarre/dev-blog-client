Hi, I'm Vin√≠cius, a Full-Stack developer from Brazil who loves working with clients from around the world helping them build their solutions into reality.


In my free time, I love exploring new technologies and building small and Open Source prototypes and this blogs is a ways of documenting my journey of doing it. I am very excited about sharing my progress and discoveries with the tech community.

Besides that, I also enjoy playing the Bass and the Guitar, reading and learning new languages.
