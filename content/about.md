## About the author

<br>

Hi, I'm Vin√≠cius, a Full-Stack developer from Brazil who loves working with clients from around the world helping them build their solutions into reality.


In my free time, I love exploring new technologies and building small and Open Source prototypes and this blogs is a ways of documenting my journey of doing it. I am very excited about sharing my progress and discoveries with the tech community.

Besides that, I also enjoy playing the Bass and the Guitar, reading and learning new languages.

## About this Blog

<br>

This blog is aimed to anyone working and exploring new technologies... My goal is to combine two passions of mine: writing and documenting my new findings and experiences in tech. 

Since I love exploring and discovering what is new, it's always fun to look around the web for new projects and exciting ideas I can work on, and, as I build some experiments with them, I aim on sharing it all here.

Furthermore, I will be sharing some books I have been reading as well as any thoughts I have when it comes to technology. Sit back and enjoy! I hope you'll having fun in this journey with me!
